# ü¶∑ Dental Bone Loss Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting **bone loss in dental X-ray images** using a YOLOv8 object detection model. It was developed as part of an AI/ML assignment provided by **Rugas Technologies**, using a labeled dataset sourced from **Roboflow** and trained on **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration.

## Project Objective
To build an AI model capable of identifying bone loss in dental radiographs with high accuracy and efficiency using modern deep learning tools.
